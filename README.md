# engineering-notes

This is not a tutorial. This is not a collection of "hello world" examples.

This repository contains engineering notes, critiques, and observations on building real software systems. It reflects deeply held opinions born from production failures, scaling constraints, and the messy reality of software engineering.

**Who this is for:**
Engineers who are tired of superficial "how-to" articles and want to understand the *why* and the *what if*. People who care about trade-offs, not just tools.

**Philosophy:**
*   **Depth over breadth.** I'd rather explore one failure mode in detail than list 50 libraries.
*   **Reality over hype.** If it doesn't work in production, it doesn't matter.
*   **Systems thinking.** Code is just one part of the equation.

If you're looking for copy-paste code, look elsewhere. If you're looking to think, stay a while.
